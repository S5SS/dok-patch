# DoK WIP Maps

## new-mp-map.zip:
Proof of concept for map modding, replaces all maps with a multiplayer compatible version of mission 10.

Extract all contents to 'Deserts of Kharak/Data/Managed' then select any map in skirmish (they will all load mission 10 atm)

## dm-khassar-ssss.zip
A working deathmatch only map for multiplayer of missions 10 from singleplayer.

To install:
1) Find your Deserts of Kharak folder (open steam client->Library->right click Deserts of Kharak->Properties->LOCAL FILES->BROWSE LOCAL FILES...)
2) Rename the `Data/Managed folder` to `Data/Managed-vanilla` (to backup its contents for when you want to return to vanilla)
3) Extract contents of the zip into `Deserts of Kharak` (so now you should have `maps` in the Deserts of Kharak` folder and `Managed` in `Deserts of Kharak/Data`)
